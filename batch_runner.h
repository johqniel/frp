This class should be specialized either to serial or parallel and should not be inherited directly.
  It receives an object of the model together with the number of replica.
  The model should have two functions of "reset" and "episode". Reset should receive an integer that indicates the iteration number.
  In its current version, user should output the results manually inside "episode" and write an script to compile them after.
